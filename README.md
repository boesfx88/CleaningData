Put run_analysis.R inside the folder UCI HAR Dataset that has been extracted

Since we only need the mean and the standard deviation, we should just ignore Inertial Signal folder and just extract data from subject, X, and Y from test and train folder.

It is said in feature_info.txt that meanFreq() is different from mean(), so meanFreq is excluded.
